Question 1: Counting Grades

The teacher wants to analyze the grades of a class. Write a Java program that takes an array of student grades (ranging from 0 to 100) and counts how many students scored above 75.

Hint :Use a loop to iterate through the array. For each grade, check if it's above 75 and increment a counter accordingly.

Question 2: Temperature Records

A weather station records the daily temperatures for a week. Write a Java program that takes an array of temperatures and calculates the average temperature.

Hint :Sum up all temperatures using a loop, then divide the sum by the number of temperatures to find the average.

------------------------------------------------

Question3: Finding the Smallest Number

Alice is playing a game where she's given a list of numbers and she needs to find the smallest number. Write a Java program to help Alice find the smallest number in an array.

Hint: Initialize a variable to store the smallest number, then iterate through the array and update the variable if a smaller number is found.

------------------------------------------------

Question 4: Identifying Even Numbers

Bob has a list of numbers, and he wants to know how many of them are even. Write a Java program to count the number of even numbers in an array.

Hint: Loop through the array and for each number, check if it's even using the modulo operator (%).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Question 5: Sum of Positive Numbers

Emma is working on a personal finance app. She wants to calculate the total income from positive transactions. Write a Java program that takes an array of transaction amounts and calculates the sum of positive amounts.

Hint: Loop through the array, and if a transaction amount is positive, add it to a sum variable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6: Counting Odd Numbers

Ethan is curious about odd numbers. He wants to count the number of odd numbers in a list. Write a Java program to help Ethan count the odd numbers in an array.

Hint:Loop through the array and for each number, check if it's odd using the modulo operator (%).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 7: Multiplying Elements

Grace is exploring multiplication. She wants to find the product of all elements in an array. Write a Java program to help Grace calculate the product of elements in an array.

Hint:Initialize a variable to store the product. Loop through the array and multiply each element with the product.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 8: Finding Prime Numbers

Hannah is fascinated by prime numbers. She wants to identify the prime numbers in a list. Write a Java program to help Hannah find the prime numbers in an array.

Hint:Loop through the array and for each number, check if it's prime. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 9: Calculating Factorial

Ian is learning about factorials. He wants to calculate the factorial of a given number. Write a Java program to help Ian calculate the factorial of a number.

Hint:Initialize a variable to store the factorial. Loop from 1 to the given number and multiply each iteration's value with the factorial.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 10: Checking for Duplicates

Olivia wants to ensure there are no duplicate elements in a list. Write a Java program to help Olivia check if an array contains any duplicate elements.

Hint: Use nested loops to compare each element with every other element. If two elements are the same, indicate that duplicates are present.
