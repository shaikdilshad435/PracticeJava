Question1: Guess the Number Game

Scenario: Carol is enthusiastic about creating a "Guess the Number" game in Java. She envisions a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100, where the player must continue guessing until they accurately identify the chosen number. The program should supply hints like "too high" or "too low" to guide the player.

Task:

Carol seeks your help in developing the "Guess the Number" game. You are required to guide her through the process of constructing the game mechanics using Java programming concepts.
Scenario Details:
- The program should:

- Generate a random number between 1 and 100 using the `java.util.Random` class.

- Prompt the player to enter a number and provide feedback, such as "too high" or "too low," after each incorrect guess.

- Continue the game until the player correctly guesses the number.

Hints:

1. Random Number Generation:

- Use the `java.util.Random`class to generate random numbers. Create an instance of the `Random` class and call the `nextInt(int bound)` method to get a random number within a specified range.

2. Loop Structure:

- Implement a loop, such as a `while` loop, to keep prompting the player for guesses until the correct number is guessed.

3. Player Input and Hints:

- Use the `java.util.Scanner` class to receive player inputs.

- Compare the player's guess with the generated random number.

- Provide hints like "too high" or "too low" to guide the player towards the correct guess.

Sample Output:

----------------------------------

Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!

I have selected a random number between 1 and 100. Try to guess it!

Enter your guess: 50

Too low! Try again.

Enter your guess: 75

Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 62

Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 56

Congratulations! You guessed the number 56! It took you 4 attempts.
